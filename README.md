Predict tracks that could belong to a playlist with Knowledge Graph Embeddings

Motivation Link prediction aims to predict relations that likely are missing in a knowledge graph. A variety of models exist nowadays that encode entities and relations of a knowledge graph in a low-dimensional vector space in order to predict missing links. The structure of information from the music domain is well fitted to be represented as a knowledge graph, with artists, albums, tracks and playlists as nodes and a variety of relationship types connecting them. Several datasets exist, where spotify playlist data was shared, with the goal of performing music recommendation.
